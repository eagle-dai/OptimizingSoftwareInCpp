    "# 4 性能与易用性\n",
    "\n",
    "性能更好的软件产品是为用户节省时间的产品。\n",
    "对于许多计算机用户来说，时间是宝贵的资源。很多时间浪费在了速度慢的，难以使用，不兼容或容易出错的软件上。\n",
    "所有这些问题都是可用性问题，我认为应该从更广泛的可用性角度来看待软件性能话题。\n",
    "\n",
    "这不是一本关于可用性的手册，但我认为有必要要让软件程序员的注意到一些常见障碍，导致用户难以有效使用软件。\n",
    "有关此主题的更多信息，请参阅我在Wikibooks上的免费电子书 [Usability for Nerds](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Usability_for_Nerds)。\n",
    "\n",
    "以下列表指出了造成软件用户的一些典型挫折和时间浪费的原因，\n",
    "以及软件开发人员应该注意的重要可用性问题。"

    "- 大的运行时框架。\n",
    ".NET框架和Java虚拟机是通常比他们正在运行的程序占用更多资源的框架。\n",
    "这样的框架常常是资源问题和兼容性问题的原由，它们会在下面情况下浪费大量时间：\n",
    "  - 在安装框架本身时\n",
    "  - 在安装运行在框架下的程序期间\n",
    "  - 程序启动期间\n",
    "  - 以及程序运行期间。\n",
    "  \n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;使用这种运行时框架的主要原因是为了跨平台的可移植性。\n",
    "不幸的是，跨平台兼容性并不总是像预期的那样好。\n",
    "我相信，通过更好的编程语言，操作系统和API的标准化，可以更高效地实现可移植性。\n",
    "\n",
    "- 内存交换。\n",
    "软件开发人员通常拥有比最终用户拥有更强的计算机，更多的内存。\n",
    "因此，开发人员可能无法看到过度的内存交换和其他资源问题，以至于资源饥渴的应用程序对最终用户表现不佳。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 安装问题。\n",
    "程序的安装和卸载程序应该标准化，并由操作系统完成，而不是由单独的安装工具完成。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 自动更新。\n",
    "如果网络不稳定或者新版本引入新的问题，自动更新软件可能会导致问题。\n",
    "更新机制通常会用唠叨的弹出消息来打扰用户，会显示请安装这个重要的新更新，甚至在用户专注于重要工作时，要求用户重新启动计算机。\n",
    "更新机制不应该中断用户，而只该静静地显示一个图标，指示更新已经可用。\n",
    "抑或在计算机重新启动时自动更新。\n",
    "软件分销商经常滥用更新机制来宣传他们软件的新版本。这对用户来说很烦人。\n"
