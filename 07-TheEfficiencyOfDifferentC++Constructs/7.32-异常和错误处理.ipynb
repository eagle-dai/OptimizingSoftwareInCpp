    "运行时错误会导致异常，这些异常以陷阱或软件中断的形式被检测到。\n",
    "代码中使用`try-catch`块可以捕获这些异常。\n",
    "如果启用了异常处理，代码却没有`try-catch`块，程序将崩溃并显示错误消息。\n",
    "\n",
    "异常处理旨在检测很少发生的错误，并以优雅的方式从错误情形中恢复。\n",
    "您可能认为只要不发生错误，异常处理就不会占用额外的时间，但不幸的是，事实并非总是如此。\n",
    "程序可能需要进行大量的信息簿记工作，才能知道如何在发生异常时进行恢复。\n",
    "这种簿记花费的成本在很大程度上取决于不同的编译器。\n",
    "一些编译器使用高效的基于表的方法，几乎没有额外开销，而其它编译器具有低效的基于代码的方法，或者依赖运行时类型识别（RTTI），会影响代码的其他部分。\n",
