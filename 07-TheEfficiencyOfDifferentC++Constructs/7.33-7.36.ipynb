    "\n",
    "前面的段落描述了一种叫做栈展开的机制。该机制用于异常处理。具体情形是：\n",
    "- 当异常发生时候，程序不进入一般的返回路径，而是跳出函数\n",
    "- 然后进行清理工作，且调用必要的析构函数\n",
    "该机制也用在下面两种情况：\n",
    "\n",
    "当线程终止时，堆栈展开机制可能被使用。\n",
    "这么做的目的是，检测线程中声明的任何对象是否有需要调用的析构函数。\n",
    "一般建议，对于需要清理的函数，在终止线程之前，主动从函数返回。\n",
    "这是因为，你不能确定对`_endthread()`的调用会清理堆栈。该清理行为依赖于系统的具体实现。\n",
    "\n",
    "当函数 `longjmp` 被用于跳出函数时，堆栈展开机制也会被使用。\n",
    "尽可能避免使用 `longjmp`。 不要在时间关键的代码中调用 `longjmp`。"
