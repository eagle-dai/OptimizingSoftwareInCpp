    "A template is similar to a macro in the sense that the template parameters are replaced by\n",
    "their values before compilation. The following example illustrates the difference between a\n",
    "function parameter and a template parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",

    "int Multiply (int x, int m) {\n",
    "   return x * m;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",

    "}\n",

    "int a, b;\n",
    "a = Multiply(10,8);\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "a and b will both get the value 10 * 8 = 80. The difference lies in the way m is transferred to\n",
    "the function. In the simple function, m is transferred at runtime from the caller to the called\n",
    "function. But in the template function, m is replaced by its value at compile time so that the\n",
    "compiler sees the constant 8 rather than the variable m. The advantage of using a template\n",
    "parameter rather than a function parameter is that the overhead of parameter transfer is\n",
    "avoided. The disadvantage is that the compiler needs to make a new instance of the\n",
    "template function for each different value of the template parameter. If MultiplyBy in this\n",
    "example is called with many different factors as template parameters then the code can\n",
    "become very big.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the template function is faster than the simple function because the\n",
    "compiler knows that it can multiply by a power of 2 by using a shift operation. x*8 is\n",
    "replaced by x<<3, which is faster. In the case of the simple function, the compiler doesn't\n",
    "know the value of m and therefore cannot do the optimization unless the function can be \n",
    "inlined. (In the above example, the compiler is able to inline and optimize both functions and\n",
    "simply put 80 into a and b. But in more complex cases it might not be able to do so).\n",
    "\n",
    "A template parameter can also be a type. The example on page 38 shows how you can\n",
    "make arrays of different types with the same template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates are efficient because the template parameters are always resolved at compile\n",
    "time. Templates make the source code more complex, but not the compiled code. In\n",
    "general, there is no cost in terms of execution speed to using templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two or more template instances will be joined into one if the template parameters are\n",
    "exactly the same. If the template parameters differ then you will get one instance for each\n",
    "set of template parameters. A template with many instances makes the compiled code big\n",
    "and uses more cache space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excessive use of templates makes the code difficult to read. If a template has only one\n",
    "instance then you may as well use a #define, const or typedef instead of a template\n",
    "parameter.\n",
    "\n",
