    "The following methods may be used for reducing the time spent on function calls in the critical part of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Avoid unnecessary functions</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming textbooks recommend that every function that is longer than a few lines\n",
    "should be split up into multiple functions. I disagree with this rule. Splitting up a function into\n",
    "multiple smaller functions only makes the program less efficient. Splitting up a function just\n",
    "because it is long does not make the program more clear unless the function is doing\n",
    "multiple logically distinct tasks. A critical innermost loop should preferably be kept entirely\n",
    "inside one function, if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Use inline functions</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "An inline function is expanded like a macro so that each statement that calls the function is\n",
    "replaced by the function body. A function is usually inlined if the inline keyword is used or\n",
    "if its body is defined inside a class definition. Inlining a function is advantageous if the\n",
    "function is small or if it is called only from one place in the program. Small functions are\n",
    "often inlined automatically by the compiler. On the other hand, the compiler may in some\n",
    "cases ignore a request for inlining a function if the inlining causes technical problems or\n",
    "performance problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "</u>**Avoid nested function calls in the innermost loop</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "A function that calls other functions is called a frame function, while a function that does not\n",
    "call any other function is called a leaf function. Leaf functions are more efficient than frame\n",
    "functions for reasons explained on page 63. If the critical innermost loop of a program\n",
    "contains calls to frame functions then the code can probably be improved by inlining the\n",
    "frame function or by turning the frame function into a leaf function by inlining all the\n",
    "functions that it calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Use macros instead of functions</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "A macro declared with #define is certain to be inlined. But beware that macro parameters\n",
    "are evaluated every time they are used. Example:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "// Example 7.34a. Use macro as inline function\n",
    "#define MAX(a,b) (a > b ? a : b)\n",
    "y = MAX(f(x), g(x));\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, f(x) or g(x) is calculated twice because the macro is referencing it twice.\n",
    "You can avoid this by using an inline function instead of a macro. If you want the function to\n",
    "work with any type of parameters then make it a template:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "// Example 7.34b. Replace macro by template\n",
    "template <typename T>\n",
    "static inline T max(T const & a, T const & b) {\n",
    " return a > b ? a : b;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another problem with macros is that the name cannot be overloaded or limited in scope. A\n",
    "macro will interfere with any function or variable having the same name, regardless of scope\n",
    "or namespaces. Therefore, it is important to use long and unique names for macros,\n",
    "especially in header files.\n"

    "**<u>Use fastcall functions</u>**\n",

    "than on the stack. This can improve the speed of functions with integer parameters.\n",
    "Floating point parameters are not affected by `__fastcall`. The implicit 'this' pointer in\n",
    "member functions is also treated like a parameter, so there may be only one free register\n",

    "parameter comes first when you are using `__fastcall`. Function parameters are\n",
    "transferred in registers by default in 64-bit mode. Therefore, the `__fastcall` keyword is\n",

    "across function calls. There are three ways to make a function local:\n",
    "\n",

    "**<u>Use whole program optimization</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some compilers have an option for whole program optimization or for combining multiple\n",
