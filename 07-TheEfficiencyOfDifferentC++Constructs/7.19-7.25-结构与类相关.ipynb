    "## 7.19 结构与类\n",

    "如今，编程教科书推荐使用面向对象编程，使软件开发更加清晰和模块化。\n",
    "对象是结构和类的实例。\n",
    "面向对象的编程风格对程序性能，既有正面又有负面的影响。积极影响是：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 如果一组变量是相同结构或类的成员，则它们一起使用，也存储在一起。这使数据缓存更有效。\n",
    "- 类成员变量不需要作为参数传递给类成员函数，避免了参数传输的开销。\n",
    "\n",
    "面向对象编程的负面影响是：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 非静态成员函数有一个'`this`'指针，它作为隐式参数传递给函数。所有非静态成员函数都会产生'`this`'参数传输的开销。\n",
    "- '`this`'指针占用一个寄存器。寄存器是32位系统中的稀缺资源。\n",
    "- 虚拟成员函数效率较低（请参阅第55页）。\n",
    "\n",
    "**关于面向对象编程的正面影响，还是负面影响占主导地位，没有一般性的定论。**\n",
    "至少，可以说使用类和成员函数，代价并不昂贵。\n",
    "你可以使用面向对象的编程风格：\n",
